# P1-CGI
9/7		pushed the initial version which can list the Shell Environment Variables
9/11	Added method to parse query string, 
		Added stylesheet
		Added .htaccess
		Added method to search on csun website using the provided query string 
		
Summary: It was a quite intersting and challenging project for me since I never deal with cgi related topics before and have limited experience working on html, css, bash and linux.
Spent few hours just to figuring out how to get the initial version to work properly. Also did a lot of research before I can actually able to code bash/linux. Learnt a lot.
